## 📥 How to Download the Code

1. Click the green **Code** button above.
2. Under the **Local** tab, choose **Download ZIP**.
3. Locate the file: `CETA_2025-main.zip`.
4. Right-click and select **Extract All** to properly unpack the folder.

Inside, you’ll find three `.ino` files for each challenge:

- 🛑 **Collision Avoidance:** `DeviousBirds_CollisionAvoidance.ino`
- 🏃 **Running the Fairway:** `DeviousBirds_RunningTheFairway.ino`
- 🌐 **IoT Wireless Connection:** `DeviousBirds_IoT.ino`

> **Upload each file separately to your robot depending on the challenge.**

**⚠️ Note:** In the IoT folder, **do not delete** any of the additional files — they’re required for the project to function properly.

## 🎨 Customization (JUST FOR YOU!!!111!1!111)

- Adding more IR sensors? You’ll need to modify the **line-following logic** and **sensor calibration**.
- Want to overhaul the code? **Feel free!** But please give us credit if you build on our work 🙌
